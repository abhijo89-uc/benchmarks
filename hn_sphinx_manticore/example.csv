It would be great if authors could link directly to the part of a paper that they are citing and be able to open that up if you want to dive deeper. Linking methods to results to discussion for specific experiments would make reading through dense papers a lot easier, and maybe have a notation&#x2F;jargon definition section open at the same time. It&#x27;s almost like a tiling window manager for reading.<p>I&#x27;m a little bit concerned about how it looks on smaller screens. It looks fine on my work monitor but I only have a netbook at home right now and a lot of websites have overlapping elements that keep me from reading articles. I haven&#x27;t looked at this from that computer yet though. Maybe it would help to have collapsible columns if there are issues.<p>Good luck, I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing where this goes!",heurist,5,31,42

I there is a security list out there that some little firewall company decided to have their devices automatically download. The list doesn&#x27;t change that often, but every single device that company made likes to check every 10 minutes or so.

Everything&#x27;s always visible, so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m looking at. I&#x27;ve scrolled down on the lowest level, and read a bit but have no understanding of the context. Clicking on it makes me realise where I am but I&#x27;ve skipped over a load of stuff in the middle so I&#x27;m scrolling back up that to find where I left off... I think this is a visual thing though rather than a major issue with the <i>idea</i>. Fiddling a bit I&#x27;ve only just found that not every node has children, but this this is only indicated by nothing happening (which is identical to something that should happen but doesn&#x27;t)<p>This is really a different formatter for the same structure of text we&#x27;ve already been using, so the hyperbole is a bit of a turnoff for me.<p><pre><code>    \section{some title}
